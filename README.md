# DL_project_DTU_LC

Repository that contains the code for the final project of the Deep Learning Course 02456 taken at DTU during Fall 2021.
Please note that the pickle files of the patients were not uploaded because of low internet connection of where I am. Thus, the model cannot be run, since the data are not present. However, one can check the results of the grid search using Tensorboard, stored in the folder `grid_search_tensorboard`.
A jupyter notebook containing the code to reproduce most of the pictures of the report (that is not present in the repository) can be found in the folder `scripts`
